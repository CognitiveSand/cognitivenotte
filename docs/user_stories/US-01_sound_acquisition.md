## User Story

**As** Alice, a knowledge worker,
**I want** to record audio on my Linux computer without any configuration,
**So that** I can capture memos and meetings effortlessly across different devices and locations.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Office Memo Recording

Alice is at her office desk with a USB microphone plugged into her desktop computer. She launches the recording application, which automatically detects the USB microphone. She dictates her memo, stops recording, and the audio is saved with a timestamp.

### Scenario 2: Meeting Recording (Different Location)

Alice is in a noisy meeting room in another building, using her laptop with its built-in microphone. She opens the recording application on her laptop - it just works with no configuration or adjustments needed despite the background noise. She records the meeting and the audio is saved in the same way as on her desktop.

## Key Principles

- **Zero configuration** - switching between devices and locations shall require no user intervention
- **Minimal interaction** - 1 click to start recording, 1 click to stop recording
